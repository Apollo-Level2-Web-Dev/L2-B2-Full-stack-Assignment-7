# Assignment-7 Full-stack (DBMS & PostgreSQL)

### Assignment Description

In this assignment, you will work with PostgreSQL, a powerful open-source relational database management system. Your task involves creating 02 tables based on the provided sample data and then writing and executing queries to perform various database operations such as creating, reading, updating etc. Additionally, you will explore concepts like LIMIT and OFFSET, JOIN operations, GROUP BY, aggregation and LIKE.

## Instructions:

### Database Setup:

-  Ensure PostgreSQL is installed on your system if not already installed.
-  Create a fresh database titled **"company_db"** or any other suitable name.

## Table Creation:

Create an **employees table** with the following fields:

-  `employee_id` (Primary Key): Integer, unique identifier for employees.
-  `employee_name`: String, representing the employee's name.
-  `age`: Integer, indicating the employee's age.
-  `email`: String, storing the employee's email address.
-  `department_id`: Integer, referencing the department the employee belongs to.
-  `salary`: Numeric, indicating the employee's salary.
-  `status`: String, storing the employee's employment status.

Create a **departments table** with the following fields:

-  `department_id` (Primary Key): Integer, unique identifier for departments.
-  `department_name`: String, indicating the department's name.

## Sample Data

-  Use the following sample data to insert into the tables:

### Departments Table:

| department_id | department_name |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| 1             | Engineering     |
| 2             | Marketing       |
